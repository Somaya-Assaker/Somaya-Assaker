LEGAL-NAME: Technology-Transfer.architectors Group (" tt.a ") 


Greetings for the morning, Greetings for the evening. Hello everyone, It's a pleasure to meet with you. I'm Somaya Assaker, the Founder&Owner Group of Technology-Transfer.architectors (“#tt.a”).

Technology-Transfer.architectors Group (#tta):

	A kickstart initiative in tech-humanrights, (deleted:  "Made-in-Türkiye" and "Made-by-Tech-Ethics") (added:  "made by a clean Syrian hand&heart,") #madefortechethics, of a #zeroCapitalBudget mobility, a #soleproprietorship, #technologystartup, #businessgroup, was first launched on LinkedIn in İstanbul, Türkiye, trademarked and copyrighted in Ankara, but was forced to pause operations, falling backwards due to challenges went against #techethics in Istanbul — to get it kicked out from Türkiye before going international towards a global outreach and relocating to another country.
 Aims to #ethicizingAlgorithms to achieve the target of #zeroHarmTech, including AI, #zeroterrorAI™, as cornerstone #digitalpublicgoods products/services to elevate #humanismfirst #algorithmiccity to top priorety and exert considerable effort on the #sociotechnonationalism regimes, together alongside the #globaldigitalcompact collaboration, #DigitalPublicGoods (DPGs), #SustainableDevelopmentGoals (SDGs), #DPGs4SDGs, #safeAI, #trustworthyAI, #trustworthytechnology
 We presume a technology-architectors forum #tta-techarchitectorsforum, that is putting forth a great deal of effort to achieve safe&trustworthy technology, including AI, and working persistently to bring an influence on ethicizing algorithmic development with the goal of advocating "Humanrights-as-first-priorety-in-technology" (#humanismfirstcity: #humanismfirstpriorety #algorithmiccity), centralizing our oprations aroud the main theme of achieving #zeroHarmTech #zeroterrorAI™, and exerts considerable effort, in collaboration with Global-Digital-Compact to address any barrier that may hinder the fight against poverty, aligned #internationaltrade to digital currencyship endeavor, specifically, when it comes to digitalising the algorithmic city platformation used for "Banking-Trading-Commercing" (T&B&C) at the heart of "AI-ethics", established trilogy model of "Fairness-Privacy-Robustness," #FairPrivateRobust the #DigitalCivilizationRights #DigitalCivicRights to #national, #international, and #global #DigitalIdentity and #verifiablecredential, for the benefit of healthy algorithm development #algorithmicHygene #EthicsofEnablingEthics when to construct the algorithmic city joint platform B&T&C-CBDC core-work ethical engineering technology
	We work hard to foster a more inclusive dialogue around the ethical implications of technology in society by prioritising human rights in digitaltechnology, an initiative seeks to inspire innovation that respects and uplifts communities rather than exploiting them. We work hard toward a responsible movement of a global outreach to defend the digital rights especially of the world's (poorest-of-the-poor) #digitalrights #poorestofpoor on earth ever??!!! for the benefit of healthy algorithm development #algorithmicHygene #EthicsofEnablingEthics when to construct the algorithmic city joint platform B&T&C - putting algorithmic ethics, its integrity, and reparation assessments first-place proactive, in a good-faith measures against algorithmic tyranny and algorithmic bias that aim to undermine our human dignity, and any cutting-edge advanced AI that could possibly assist in the creation of potentially hazardous technological oversight that affects wealth and income inequality. In this way, the desired regulations can be established to ensure that AI systems for digital public infrastructure have the appropriate transparency and accountability to reverse the negative impact of technology on poverty.

#tta-mission 

centralising our operations within the main theme of #zeroHarmTech, #zeroterrorAI™, to achieve the target aims to #ethicizingAlgorithms, bring the civic awareness to their digital rights to live in their #humanismfirstcity, free-from-terror-and-horrer,tackling any unethical digital practices against #techharms, held by #unethicizingalgorithm practices, threatening our #digital #civicsafety, #civicsecurity, #socialgood, #digitalpublicgood, #humanitywellbeing, #civilizationrights, and #livingsrights, and blind terror AI held by technology development, including AI, #algorithmicprejudice, #algorithmictyranny, #algorithmicbias, held by the name of techethics to be used to develop #digitalGoodness4peace #digitalfootprint our #peaceful #digitalCitizenArchitect #digitalcitizenshipArchitect, #digitalcivilizationArchitect, our beloved #algorithmiccity!

#tta-service

Registration according to Türkpatent’s classification of three NICE classes (35, 41, 42) to perform R&D&I, offering the proper consultancy and capacity-building support to group mission, defending the #digitalhumanitywellbeing, #digitalcivilizationrights, #digitalpublicgood, #livingsrights, and #socialgood - in conjuction with the 5-objectives of the Global-Digital-Compact (GDC), to: close digital divides, accelerate progress to achieve Sustainable-Development-Goals (SDGs), and expand digital economy inclusion, open, safe and secure digital space that respect human rights in complemet to Digital-Public-Goods (DPG), advanced responsible AI governance for the benefit of the whole humanity.

#tta-type

We persume a technology-architectors forum, that is putting forth a great deal of effort to achieve safe&trustworthy technology, including AI, working persistently to bring an influence on ethicizing algorithmic development with the goal of advocating " humanrights-as-first-priorety-in-technology " for the algorithmiccity #humanismfirstcity: #humanismfirstpriorety #algorithmiccity, centralizing our oprations within main theme of achieving #zeroHarmTech, #zeroterrorAI™, putting into a considerable effort, together alongside the Global-Digital-Compact collaboration, to tackle any obstacle that hinder combating poverty, aligned #internationaltrade to #digitalcurrencyship endeavour.

#tta-legaldiscourse 

Under the legal discourse of #independent #neutral #private to advocate for uplifting #sociotechnonatioalism regimes that support the "Model-of-Knowledge" to digital citizenship literacy, while define our value-proposition, #tta-valuepropositioning, to shape the “national-digital-identity" #Nationalidentity in cross-border transactions, from #Internationalidentity #techologyadvisor #federalinnovator to #technolocalism, #subjectmatterexpert to #technointernationalism, to position ourselves globally #technoglobalism as tech-enthusiasts human-righters, who support the neutrality independence #neutral#independent, in judging the technology fairness representation of technology acts as in a free-zone represetative of digital ethical privacy compliance in the global dialogue #freezones4digitalprivacy #ethicalCompliance #privacyComplaince #GlobaldigitalDialogue, by which, would be capale to address machine learning bias #algorithmicbiasML and fight against #algorithmicprejudice #algorithmictyranny #techharms #thecyberneticbrain and #cyberneticsofcybernetics, Furthermore, we privately conduct technology-transfer digitalisation #private, and apart from any influences #independent! Pausing the broken moral promises held by the name of fake #freedom4science #openscience, which goes against #techEthics of #generalEthics, #certainEthics, #unethicalEthics, and #noethics at all, that goes against #socialgood, against #digitalpublicgood, against #humanitywellbeing, against #civilization and against #livingsrights! We cannot rely on the sacrifices of the others for the benefit of our healthy algorithm development #algorithmicHygene #EthicsofEnablingEthics when to construct our beloved algorithmic city joint platforms while kicking out the rights of the #poorestofthepoor on planet - impossile to proceed further anymore!

#tta-membershipRules

:: we need a powerful voice in ethicising digital civic algorithmic development in this digital era. A leading voice e-of-things: subject-matter-expert in AI ethics to encourage thoughtful development rather than retrofitting safeguards to bring the right voices of the right collaborative working - the right harmonisation of common understanding, and transparently shared with the public, to bring the right prioritization our response to accountability is being a proactive early interventional so we can really prevent harms in digital space while committing to actionable-accountable-democracy.
:: we want to work together tackling #techharms in society threatening our {ethicisim-algorithmic-civic}. Especially targeting the poorest of the poor living on earth ever! Somebody has to shout for a wake-up call, guys; we are collapsing!!
